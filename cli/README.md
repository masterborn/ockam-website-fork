# Helper CLI for project

This in the nutshell bash aliases with functions helping to run different project related tasks. It is easy to extend by anyone who knows bash.

## Installation
First copy `example.cli.config` to `cli.config` and setup your config. Then need to source the `ockam.aliases` file. After that you type `ockam<double-tab>`to see all available commands. E.g.:

```shell
$ ockam.<tab><tab>
ockam.command1             ockam.command2              ockam.command3             ockam.command4           
ockam.command5             ockam.command6
```

You can add it to your `.bashrc` or whatever initial script you use to have it on terminal open.
